                    <p>Maharana Pratap, the crowned ruler of Mewar, was born in 1540 and died on January 19, 1597. The Mewar ruler was regarded as one of the bravest Rajput warriors and was well-known for his memorable fights against the Mughals. Known by his people as Mewari Rana, he passed away as a hero for his people. Even though centuries have been passed since his death, Rajasthan still honours the Mewar ruler as a hero for all of his bravery, sacrifice, and determination.The emperor Rana Udai Singh’s son and heir was Maharana Pratap. Following his father’s death in 1572, senior courtiers believed Pratap was the perfect candidate for king and that his exceptional qualities would enable them to deal with the situation they were facing with Mughals at the time. In 1572, Maharana Pratap took over his father’s throne and ruled Mewar. Unlike the previous Rajput emperors, Maharana Pratap resisted the vast Mughal army that came before him, fighting bravely till his very last breath, according to the Cultural India study. He represents Rajput bravery, devotion, and chivalry to both his people and the next generation. Maharana Pratap was married to eleven women, had five daughters, and seventeen sons. He tied the knot for the first time in 1557 with Maharani Ajabde Punwar. His eldest son’s name was Amar Singh I, who later succeeded him and became the ruler of Mewar.To honour Maharana Pratap’s valour and boldness, a historical site has been established. A Maharana Pratap memorial is situated at the top of Udaipur’s Moti Magri, Pearl Hill. The life-size bronze statue of the valiant warrior mounted on his horse is displayed, which was constructed by Maharana Bhagwat Singh Mewar.</p>

                    <p>The Vijaya Stambha is an imposing victory monument located within Chittor Fort in Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, India. The tower was constructed by the Hindu Rajput king Rana Kumbha of Mewar in 1448 CE to commemorate his victory over the army of Malwa led by Mahmud Khilji in the Battle of Sarangpur. The tower is dedicated to Hindu God Vishnu. Colonel James Todd considered it one of the finest examples of Hindu Rajput architecture & superior to Qutub Minar.To commemorate this great victory, Rana Kumbha built the great Vijay Stambha (Tower of Victory) in the fortress of Chittor. However, before this tower could be completed, the Rana had to face and vanquish the combination of two most powerful kingdoms in India at the time, those of Gujarat and Malwa, these glorious events are inscribed on the celebrated tower. Sultan Mahmud Khilji remained a prisoner in Chittor for a period of six months, after which he was liberated with ransom by Rana Kumbha.The inscribed slabs in the uppermost storey containing a detailed genealogy of the rulers of Chittaur and their deeds is ascribed to Rana Kumbha court scholar, Atri and his son Mahesh.The Vijaya Stambha is a remarkable example of religious pluralism practised by the Rajputs. </p>

            <h2 class="headline-1 section-title" style="color: black;">"Kirti Stambha"</h2>

            <div class="section-text" style="color: black;">
                <p>Chittor has a history going back several centuries. It was an ancient centre of Jain tradition. Chittor is adjacent to the ancient city of Madhyamika. The Jain inscriptions at Mathura from the Kushana period (1st–3rd centuries CE) mention a "Majjhimilla" branch of the "Kottiya" gana, indicating that it was a major Jain centre.
                  There was a scholar Elacharya at Chittor from whom Vira-senacharya (9th century) learned the ancient Shat-khandagama and Kashayapahuda.[1] Virasena later wrote the famous "Dhavala" and "Jayadhavala" on the basis of these books.
                  The 22 metres (72 ft) tower was built by a Jain merchant Jeeja Bhagerwala during the reign of Rawal Kumar Singh in c. 1179–1191 CE.[1][2][3][4] It was the residence of Jinavallabha who propagated the Vidhimarga in the 12th century. From the 15th to 17th centuries, it was the seat of a Bhattaraka.[5]
                  Three inscriptions have been found that mention Jija of Bagherwal community as the builder of the stambha.[6] One of the inscriptions mention Dharmakirti, the disciple of Shubhakirti, who was disciple of Vasantkirti.[5] According to the Balatkara Gana Pattavali, Dharmakirti headed the patta during 1224-1257 CE. Thus the structure dates from the 13th century, although an unrelated Jain inscription of 896 CE was found in the vicinity.[7] Kirti Stambha is older than another tower in the same fort, known as the Vijay Stambha (Tower of Victory).[8] </p>
